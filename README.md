# Banking-Interface

Well this change might give you a little bit of a challenge.

Since both you and I are updating the repository. the changes have to synchronized. Any change you try to push to the repository will give you a problem since i made a change before you.

It means you need to pull teh changes before you can commit and push your change.

Learn about how to do that.

Second task is to create an issue and learn issue management.

I will create an issue to get things sarted. The idea with issues is to track the things you want to add to you applications. each issue will relate to some funtionality with some details on how the feature/functon work.
